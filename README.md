# Bourbon_git
This application uses Node.js, an api in Express, Knex to manipulate the Sqlite3 database, and EJS to show in a browser. Also uses middleware of method-override and dotenv. 
This application queries the database and displays my boubon collection in a way that I can immediatly update or delete each entry from the same place.  There is another
form to add new bourbon to the database and for viewing pleasure. It is currently deployed and be viewed here => https://mybourbon.herokuapp.com/

Future expectations are: 
1) add a login feature for security.
2) add users for view only and users with admin privledges.
3) add pictures of each bourbon.
4) add a place to blog about each bourbon so visitors can share their specific experiences with each delicous bourbon.
